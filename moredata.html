			<p>Hi, I’m Ebuka, a data analyst with a keen interest in finding insights and solutions from data. 
				I have completed an intensive 6-month data analysis course where I learned how to use various 
				data analytics tools and techniques to work with different types of data. </p> <br>

				<p> Here are some of the skills and projects that I have acquired and completed:</p> <br>
				
				<li> Proficient in SQL, Excel, Power BI, and Tableau.</li>
				<li>Completed two online projects where I applied data analysis skills to real-world datasets. 
					One project involved analyzing COVID-19 data and creating interactive dashboards and reports to visualize the trends and impacts of the pandemic. 
					The other project involved performing web scraping and text analysis on online job postings and creating a recommendation system to match job seekers with suitable jobs. </li>
				<li> Earned several badges and certificates from online platforms, such as ALX and Explore AI, to demonstrate my data analytics competencies and knowledge. 
					You can see my badges and certificates [here].</li>

				I am passionate about learning new things and exploring new possibilities with data. 
				I am always looking for opportunities to improve my skills and apply them to real-world problems. 
				<p>I also enjoy playing video games, listening to music, and watching movies. 
					Fun fact: I can play three musical instruments and I’m learning a fourth one.</p>
					<br>
				
				If you are interested in data, want to collaborate on a project, or need a data analyst for your business, feel free to contact me at ebuksmaduks@gmail.com. You can also follow me on [LinkedIn] and [Twitter]. 
				<p>Here is my [resume] if you want to know more about me and my work. I hope to hear from you soon!</p>
